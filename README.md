## Installation
* Clone this repo, and we'll call the directory that you cloned as ${FAIRMOT_ROOT}
* Install dependencies. We use python 3.8 and pytorch >= 1.7.0
```
conda create -n FairMOT
conda activate FairMOT
conda install pytorch==1.7.0 torchvision==0.8.0 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
cd ${FAIRMOT_ROOT}
pip install cython
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* We use [DCNv2_pytorch_1.7](https://github.com/ifzhang/DCNv2/tree/pytorch_1.7) in our backbone network (pytorch_1.7 branch). Previous versions can be found in [DCNv2](https://github.com/CharlesShang/DCNv2).
```
git clone -b pytorch_1.7 https://github.com/ifzhang/DCNv2.git
cd DCNv2
./make.sh
```
* In order to run the code for demos, you also need to install [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).
